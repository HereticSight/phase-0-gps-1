* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?  
I didn't really understand all the components of the git fetch, push, and merge commands.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?  
The git fetch, push, and merge commands, as well as merge conflicts.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?  
I asked my pair to explain parts of the commands I didn't understand, such as what the "origin master" part in the 'git push origin master' command meant. 

* What still confuses you about Git?  
I understand it better now, but I still struggle with remembering the structure of some commands.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?  
I was nervous! Felt a little rushed since we only had an hour, but I definitely learned a lot, and it was helpful to have a guide for the first pairing session.

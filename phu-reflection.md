* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? I had a good grasp of most of the git concepts prior to the GPS.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS? The markdown language was slightly clarified in the GPS. I had some confusion with whether the `*Text*` was italics or bold due to differences in programs.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? I had a quick question related to Markdown.

* What still confuses you about Git? I think I have a good grasp of how git works, but I believe I would just need to work with it more in order to feel more comfortable with it.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? My first experience pairing in a GPS was a bit nerve-wracking since there was a guide watching us work, but overall I had a good time and felt comfortable working in this way.
